  title: ü™∑ Lotus34 API ‚Äî Vietnam‚Äôs New Provincial Gateway
  description: |-
    As of July 1st, 2025, Vietnam underwent a sweeping administrative transformation, consolidating its 63 provinces
    into 34 and streamlining its governance structure from three tiers‚Äîprovince, district, and commune‚Äîto just two:
    province and commune. This landmark reform, the most significant in centuries, marks a bold leap toward
    modernization and administrative efficiency.

    Lotus34 is a RESTful API purpose-built to deliver core information about Vietnam's newly defined provinces.
    It provides:

    üìç Province Details: Official names, areas and populations

    üÜî ID Card Region Codes: Region codes tied to each province

    üöó Vehicle Plate Numbers: License plate code ranges per province

    ‚òéÔ∏è Telephone area code: Landed telephone code per province

    üèòÔ∏è Child Communes: A full list of communes within each province
    
    Whether you're building data visualizations, powering location-based services, or integrating national datasets,
    Lotus34 is your gateway to Vietnam‚Äôs revolutionary new provincial structure.
